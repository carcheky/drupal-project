# Drupal Development project

Project scaffold base to start developing Drupal projects, modules and even core. The project scaffold sits on top
[Wodby's Docker4Drupal stack][1] and [Drupal Composer project][2].

## Starting

Before starting the project copy de provided *env* file a *.env* and edit and change to meet your needs. Also if you have cloned this repository **delete** the .git folder on the project root to avoid targeting scaffold repository.

> **IMPORTANT!** MacOS users pay attention to the PHP tag since use a different image than Linux (default).
> **DON'T FORGET** To add the configured project URL in your OS hosts file.
